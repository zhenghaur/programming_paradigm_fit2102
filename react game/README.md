# FIT2102 Assignment 1

All of your changes, code, and game files should be in the src folder.

## Development

There are two ways to run the code:

1. Build the code and then open the web page

- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run build`
- Open the html file dist/index.html (NOT src/index.html)

2. Use the development server

- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run dev`, this will automatically open a web page at localhost:4000
- Open localhost:4000 in your browser if it didn't already

The development server will have some additional features that help with the
development process, but are not essential.
